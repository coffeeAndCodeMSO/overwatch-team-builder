# Overwatch team builder
A platform that allows users to create teams for the Blizzard game 'Overwatch'.

## Tools
This project is a dive into Amazon Web Services as a way to learn the benefits of cloud services to host an app vs creating your own local server. 
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS S3
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS IAM (possible switching to another method so that we can use Blizzard API)
- React
- React-Redux (possibly)

## Tutorial
This project follows the tutorial from [serverless-stack.com](https://serverless-stack.com) to build the core functionality of the app which will then be extended upon.
